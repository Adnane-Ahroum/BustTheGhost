## üìñ About The Project

**Bust the Ghost** is an AI-powered game developed in Unity that demonstrates practical applications of probabilistic reasoning and inference algorithms. Players must locate hidden ghosts on a grid using sensor readings and Bayesian probability updates. Each sensor provides information about nearby ghost locations, and players must use logical deduction to pinpoint the exact position.

The game showcases how probabilistic inferencing can be applied in interactive environments, making it both educational and entertaining.

## üéØ How to Play

1. **Objective:** Find and bust all hidden ghosts on the game grid
2. **Sensors:** Use sensors to detect ghost proximity - they provide probability distributions
3. **Inference:** Analyze sensor data to deduce ghost locations
4. **Bust:** Click on suspected locations to bust the ghosts
5. **Win:** Successfully locate all ghosts to win the game!

### Controls
- **Mouse Click:** Place sensors and bust ghosts
- **UI Buttons:** Navigate menus and reset game
